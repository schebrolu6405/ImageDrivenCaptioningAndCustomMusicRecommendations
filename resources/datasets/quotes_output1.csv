Whatever is good for your soul, do that
Even the stars were jealous of the sparkle in her eyes
Stress less and enjoy the best
Get out there and live a little
I’m not high maintenance, you’re just low effort
I’m not gonna sugar coat the truth, I’m not Willy Wonka
Life is better when you’re laughing
Look for the magic in every moment
Vodka may not be the answer, but it’s worth a shot
A sass a day keeps the basics away
Me, myself, and I
Just me
But first, let me take a selfie
Typical me
Selfie Sunday
I was born to shine
Me doing me
I don’t always take a selfie, but when I do…
What do you think of this look?
I woke up like this
Couldn’t be happier 🙂
You can regret a lot of things, but you’ll never regret being kind
Do whatever makes you happiest
“Having the dream is easy, making it come true is hard” —Serena Williams
Decluttering my life like Marie Kondo
If I were rich, I’d pull a Netflix and spend $100 million on my Friends
In 2024, I want to be as Insta famous as an egg and as ageless as Paul Rudd
Can’t hear, can’t speak, can’t see.
“Be heroes of your own stories” —Constance Wu
“Hella fine and it works every time” —Ariana Grande
My life is as crooked as Rami Malek’s bowtie
We did it!
Work hard then work harder
Hustlin’
When daydreams become reality
Say yes, take risks, and live life on your own terms
The impossible is now possible
Perseverance pays … a lot!
It wasn’t always easy but it’s worth it
Pursue your passion and you’ll never work a day in your life
Entrepreneur life
Just the two of us
He’s my best friend
He’s my king, I’m his queen
Sometimes relationships end so love stories can begin
We are totally #couplegoals
My world, my heart, my everything
Bae
My one and only
My love
You’re my 1 in 7 billion
Friends are like stars, constantly coming and going, but the ones that stay burn as bright as the sun
A good friend might know your wild stories but your best friend was right there with you
I would never let my best friend do anything stupid … alone
bff ❤️
Laughing at random things. Partying ‘til the sunrise. There’s no one else I’d want by my side. Love ya!
Hold onto your best friend because you’ll never find someone like them again
Back in the old days my best friend was quiet and shy. I turned her into a monster. 😜
Find someone who brings out the best in you

Life is tough but so am I

Ugh …
Heaven
Speechless.
#Goals
OMG!
Surprise!
Awkward …
Act like you own the world, because you do
As long as my bank account keeps growing, I couldn’t care less about anything else
I keep it real because I’m not afraid of having enemies
… um ok
You were my cup of tea, but I drink wine now
Ambition on fleek
I wouldn’t chase you because I’m the catch
Know your worth but don’t forget to add tax
I’m the reason why I smile everyday
I don’t care if you approve of me, I approve of myself

Leavin’ on a jet plane
Guess where I am
Work. Save. Travel. Repeat.
Time for an adventure!
Wanderlust
Wouldn’t wanna be anywhere else
Be right back, exploring the world
I travel because you can always get more money, but you can never get more time
Just gonna cross this off the bucket list …
Her meow melts my heart
I saw ya sniffin’ around...is it me you’re looking for?!
I LOVE SCRATCHESSSS!
The purrty has spoken
OMG! Mom! Is that furr me?!
You went outside without me, hooman? Unacceptable!
It’s gettin’ hot out here, I got on too much fur ....
Hmm how did I get up here?
Grocery shopping today with Hooooman 
Whisker Wednesday. So nice outside today.
Happy #Caturday y’all
Happiness comes in waves.
Sun of a beach!
Good times and tan lines.
Life is better with the sand between your toes
Nama’stay at the beach.
Sorry, out on a beach relaxing. Be back soon!
I love you to the sand bar and back.
Passports and palm trees
BEACH: Best Escape Anyone Can Have
“If you think adventure is dangerous; try routine. It’s lethal.” —Paulo Coelho
Go to the place where you feel most alive
A walk in the woods feels like home
By getting lost in nature, you get closer to finding yourself
If you’re looking for heaven on earth step outside

The mountains call to me
“If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need” — Marcus Tullius Cicero
If you’re looking for beauty, you’ll find it in nature
Life is short and the world is wide so get out there and explore it
Wherever you go, leave a trail
An apple a day will keep anyone away if you throw it hard enough
Give second chances but not for the same mistake
Never sacrifice three things: family, love, and/or yourself
I’m an original and that’s perfection in itself
You can’t dull my sparkle ✨
Be the person you needed when you were young
Life is about taking chances and having fun
So grateful for this moment
I’m thankful for the struggles that made me the person I am today
Life is the biggest party you’ll ever be at
Messy bun and having fun
I got it from my mama
A great girl is classy not trashy
Girls are changing the world
Who run the world? GIRLS.
Just like my eyeliner, I always wing it
I’m not one in a million, I’m one in 7 billion
Leave a little sparkle everywhere you go
I’m wild and free
The only person I dress to impress is me
Boys will be boys
Chillin’ with my bros
Boys got swagger, men have style, but gentlemen have class
A great man is strong because he can be gentle
Haters are my greatest motivators
A real man provides, protects and perseveres
The only time a man should ever lie is to surprise someone
No guts, no glory
Release the beast within
Be a warrior in a room of worriers
Good food, good mood
I’m on a seafood diet. I see food I eat it.
Never settle for just one scoop
Don’t be upsetti, eat some spaghetti
Chocolate is cheaper than therapy
Waffles are just pancakes with abs
Food before dudes
When you’re downie eat a brownie
Pasta la vista baby
You can’t live a full life on an empty stomach
Resting coffee face
Hocus pocus I need coffee to focus
Life is better with a coffee in hand
I like big cups and I cannot lie
Taking a little coffee break
Feeling depresso without my espresso
I like myself how I like my coffee: dark, bitter, and too hot for you
Caffeine Queen
Too much Monday, not enough coffee
When things go wrong, coffee helps
Oh hey there!
Short and sweet
…
I got nothing
Insert witty Instagram caption here
Just livin’ life
Just chillin’
Today’s perfect
Yup, another food pic
Why so serious?
Time for a change
Tears come straight from the heart
Sometimes, at night, I hope to fall asleep before I fall apart
I didn’t change. You did. You stopped loving me.
“Learning is a gift. Even if pain is the teacher.” —Maya Watson
As a kid I was afraid of monsters under my bed, but as I grow older I realize they live inside my head.
Want to be happy? Care less.
Until you’ve heard my story, you have no idea
Even when I’m sad, I show off my big smile anyways
I miss you …
The rumor is true, I’m sad. Again.
I’d rather be someone’s Sunday morning, not Saturday night
Be the EXTRA in extraordinary
I don’t believe in SOMEDAY, I believe in TODAY
When life gives me lemons, I make lemonade then sell it
My life my rules
I’m not lucky, I’m talented
You can beat me down but I’ll just jump back up
I may be down to earth but I’m still above you
I’m confident, your opinion of me won’t change that
I’ve got hustle and heart
Don’t be average, be savage
It’s not my fault truth hurts, here’s a Band-Aid
Be the kind of person that makes others step up their game
Single as a dollar but not looking for change
Well-behaved people don’t make it into history books
Looks aren’t everything but I have them just in case
People say I act like I don’t care but it’s not an act
I can easily tell how intelligent someone is by how stupid they think I am
I’m classy, sassy, and a bit badassy
I’ve got my sassy pants on. Watch out world!
I’m too glam to give a damn
Who let the dogs out?
You are pawfection
My dog is the only friend I need
Sorry can’t hangout, my dog and I have plans
Be the kind of person your dog thinks you are
My dog thinks I’m kind of a big deal
I’d rather be at home with my dog
I have the best dog
As long as you have your dog’s love, you have everything
Hush puppy
Proud cat lady
She’s purrfect
You’ll never regret time spent with your cat
Home is where my cat is
You had me at meow
Life is better with cats
Owning a cat is like eating M&M’s—you can’t have just one
Fur real though
I litter-ally can’t live without my cat
I’ve been feline good today
“She believed she could, so she did.” —R.S. Grey
“An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.” —Benjamin Franklin
“The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” —Eleanor Roosevelt

When you’re so close to victory 🏆
“I don't know where I'm going from here, but I promise it won't bore you.” —David Bowie
Here’s to all the fun memories, late nights, and cups of coffee that got me here
It’s time to pursue my purpose
BRB. Working on my dreams.
When I feel like giving up on my dreams, I keep sleeping
The best workout is a cross between a lunge and a crunch. Lunch.
If I was funny, I’d have a better Instagram caption for this
insert funny Instagram caption here
This is my pretty hungry face
Putting the “we” in weird
We’re all born a little crazy, some of us just choose to stay that way
We all have that one friend …
I don’t know what’s tighter: my jeans or our love
Mirror: you look amazing today. Camera: Nope, you don’t.
I’m a model … Well … an Instagram model. Same thing right?
But first, let me take 40 selfies until choosing one that actually works
Namast’ay in bed
You’re like a four-leaf clover: hard to find and lucky to have
You’re amazing, brave, strong, beautiful, and perfect in every way
So much to be thankful for
Nothing shines brighter than a heart of gold
Mistakes are proof that you’ve tried
The journey is always the best part
Today’s the best kind of day
Life is only as legendary as you make it
Good vibes only
Livin’ the good life
Don’t judge someone by their mistakes but on how they fix them
If I don’t post a picture, did it even really happen?
They call me ranch ’cuz I be dressing
One does not simply create a clever Instagram caption
Maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s the Clarendon filter
If the world was created in 7 days but it took 9 months to make me, I’m clearly a big deal
People will judge everything you do, so you do you
I just rolled my eyes so hard I saw my brain
You never realize how boring your life is until someone asks you what you do for fun
You know you’ve made it when your idols become your rivals
Be the type of person you want to meet
Just two friends having a good time
Guess who I just met?
Best. Day. EVER!
What just happened?
Go BIG or go home
Treat yourself like a king and you’ll attract your queen
This is GOLD
This is it!
Express gratitude. Regret nothing.
Motivation Monday? I’m motivated seven days a week
Taco Tuesday is my favorite day of the week
It’s Wednesday so here’s my wise quote of the day … actually I got nothing.
Here’s a Throwback Thursday picture. If you don’t comment aww, I’ll unfollow you.
Friday, my second favorite F word
“Friday, Friday, gotta get down on Friday”
It’s Sleepy Sunday. So here’s a selfie of me pretending to sleep.
Weekend Vibes …
This basically sums up my entire weekend
This is me in all my glory
Your smile is my favorite
Je t’adore
Keep your chin up so your crown doesn’t slip
Be kind. Be love.
Follow your heart in everything you do
Don’t live a life regretting the things you didn’t do. Go do things!
All I could ever want is right in front of me
Don’t wait for the storm to pass, go out there and dance in the rain
She brings out the best in me
Pumpkin and spice and everything nice
You’re my favorite BOO!
Creep it real
Happy Halloween!
This is spooktacular
Straight Outta Coffin
I’m under your spell
Bow down witches!
If you’ve got it, haunt it
Trick or treat?
It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Silent night … Oh, well we tried.
This is my Christmas list, don’t forget to check it twice
Falalalalalalalala
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas. But if the white runs out, pour me some red.
Don’t get your tinsel in a tangle
Hanging out under the mistletoe
Drink up Grinches, it’s Christmas
Can I wrap you up?
’Tis the season to be jolly
Happy New Year, everyone!
It’s only January 1st and I’ve already failed at my resolutions …
365 new days, chances, and opportunities to go after
New year, new look
2024: new chapter or same old story? Let’s wait and see.

Feelin’ hot, hot, hot
Sea, Sun and Smiles 🙂
Summer lovin’ happened so fast
Chasin’ the sun
Blue skies, high tides and good vibes
Hello sunshine!
Life’s a beach
I never want summer to end
Eat, tan, sleep, repeat
This is my resting beach face
Every day I’m shovelin’
Just chillin’, literally
Cold hands, warm heart, can’t lose
Snowflake it ’til you make it
There’s no business like snow business
It’s a winter-ful life
There’s snowplace like home
Chillin’ like a villain
Hakuna Snow-tata!
You’re never too old to make snow angels
What a re-leaf it’s finally spring
It’s barefoot season!
Every daisy is better because of you
Sunshine is the best medicine
Rose over bros
Sunshine is my favorite accessory
Recently: 🌸🌱☀️
Just springin’ around
The flowers are blooming and so are my allergies
Flowers need time to bloom. So do you.
Don’t stop be-leafing
Hangin’ with the leaves
Maybe she’s born with it. Maybe it’s maple leaves
I never want to leaf this beautiful place
What’s my blood type? Pumpkin spice
A pic of me chai-ing on some cute fall sweaters
I 🍩 care what you say, fall is the best season!
Fall-ing in love with these colors
Lit like my fall-scented candles
Fall weather = nap weather.
Just your average Monday morning commute
It’s a chill in bed kinda day
Hitting the books today
Me jamming out to New Music Friday
So this just happened!!!!
Sleep like no one’s watching
“Life is a practice. You are what you do each day.” – Isaac Asimov
Exercise: check
Today’s been the best day
Let’s get the party started!
Today’s a great day, you can’t stand in my way
One day when you finally call, I won’t respond, but my assistant will
It may hurt a lot now, but I’m strong enough to handle it
Just vibes
When the sun goes down, that’s when you see me glow
Developing some good habits today
If good things come to those who wait, I’m gonna be an hour late to our date
It’s good that you have two hands because I can be a handful
Every heart has a story waiting to be told
Life is all about smiles and high fives
Beast mode activated
Keep your squats low and your standards high
The awkward moment when you’re wearing a Nike shirt but you just can’t do it
Does refusing to use the elliptical count as resistance training?
Pain is weakness leaving the body
Train like a beast
Sweaty is pretty
Working my butt off to get a better after photo
I HAVE ABSolutely no excuse
Getting WHEYsted
